= Description =
This is a work in progress and this tool is not intended for anyone's use but mine.  Use of the software and instructions provided by this repository is unlicensed, unsupport, and not guaranteed.

= History =
I've become a bit drained by the high price of integration and automation software.  So, I'm making a repository to hold some stuff that I've done over the years and to maybe bring it all together in one application if I can.  I'm am not a programmer by trade, and barely one by hobby.  Any code or scripts provided will be written in my current language of choice.  My current fad is Python3.  Hope you don't mind snakes.

= To Do =
1. Figure out what the heck I actually want to do here
2. Put it all together

= Current Goal =
1. Get an Apache install running infront of a Django instance.
2. Get Django local authentication working
3. Get an API written for the Django instance.  I want everything to be API based, and leave the representation up to the client (will probably include a web interface of my own as well that uses the API).
4. Get an LDAP instance running
4. Get Django LDAP authentication functioning

# Instructions #
I've not done anything yet.  So, there is nothing to see here.
